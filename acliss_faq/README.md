Custom-Objects-in-concrete5-Demo
================================

Shows how to create models for objects, a database item list for 
searching and filtering those objects, dashboard pages for searching 
and editing, and front end code for displaying those objects 
with dummy urls.

This code is in concrete5 package format.  It should be placed in your
packages folder inside of a folder called 'acliss_faq' and can
then be installed from the dashboard.
